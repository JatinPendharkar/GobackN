SIMULATION AND MODELLING OF GO-BACK_N PROTOCOL â€“ COMMUNICATION NETWORKS

Language and Platform: Omnet++ and C++

About: The objective of this project is to model, simulate and analyze the Go-Back-N protocol. Go-Back-N protocol is based on sliding window flow control method. Go-Back-N ARQ is a specific instance of the automatic repeat request (ARQ) protocol, in which the sending process continues to send a number of frames specified by a window size even without receiving an acknowledgement (ACK) packet from the receiver. It is a special case of the general sliding window protocol with the transmit window size of N and receive window size of 1. It can transmit N frame.
